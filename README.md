# Mangrove-Restoration
This project develops a drone-assisted mangrove restoration concept using seedballs to support rehabilitation in degraded and hard-to-access coastal areas. The approach addresses limitations of conventional manual planting, particularly in muddy, flooded, or spatially extensive sites.

## Problem Statement
Mangrove restoration is often constrained by:
- Difficult terrain and tidal conditions
- High labour and logistical costs
- Limited access to degraded or remote zones
- These constraints reduce restoration scale and long-term effectiveness.

## Proposed Approach
1) Seedball Technique
- Mangrove propagules or seeds coated with clay, soil, and organic matter
- Protects seeds from predation, desiccation, and tidal displacement

2. Drone-Assisted Deployment
- Multirotor drones used for targeted aerial dispersal
- Enables access to flooded, muddy, or unsafe areas
- Reduces physical disturbance and labour intensity

3. Site Considerations
- Tidal regime and inundation frequency
- Substrate stability
- Existing mangrove cover and degradation level

## Objectives
- Explore the feasibility of aerial seedball deployment for mangroves
- Develop a replicable restoration workflow
- Support nature-based solutions for coastal protection and climate adaptation
  
## Expected Benefits
- Increased restoration coverage
- Reduced labour and operational costs
- Lower soil compaction and ecological disturbance
- Potential for rapid post-disaster restoration

## Project Status
2 patents from Government of Indonesia and on progress field trial in Java island
